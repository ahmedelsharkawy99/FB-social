### Model

The model contains all the data and business logic of the application. In this project, the model consists of a simple JavaScript object that stores the user data and posts.

### View

The view is responsible for rendering the user interface of the application. In this project, the view is implemented using HTML and CSS.

### Controller

The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view. It handles user input and updates the model and view accordingly. In this project, the controller is implemented using JavaScript.

## Usage
